Since graduating from undergrad in 2018 I've known that I've wanted to go back to school to get my masters just because I love learning new things and expanding my horizons, and I'm really excited to finally be on this path. All of my undergraduate work was in Java, however most of my career work has been in C++ so I feel proficient in both. I'm also familiar with Python. In general I'm organized and detail oriented, which admittedly can sometimes lead to a little bit of perfectionism. I'm good at sticking to schedules, and I prefer to get things done early enough that there is some wiggle room in case there are any last minute roadblocks. (I'm also a big NFL fan and try to get things done early enough to avoid doing work during the games on Sundays!). I like to have work delegated and have clear, defined tasks for everyone on the team. I've worked on small teams since I began my professional career, and enjoy working with others, being a team player and working together to make sure the team succeeds. In my spare time I love to read, take pictures, and explore the outdoors.

first player to\n                accurately guess who did it, where, and with what. When the game\n                is initialized, a suspect, room, and weapon card are randomly\n                chosen and hidden from the players. If a player is able to guess\n                the correct cards in the form of an accusation, they win the\n                game. However, if their accusation is incorrect the player is\n                out of the game and loses. The game consists of 4 to 6 players,\n                each of whom are assigned turns determined by the order in which\n                they joined the game. Turns continue until a player has made an\n                accurate accusation and wins the game, or all players have\n                accused incorrectly, in which case the game is over.\n              </p>\n              <p id=\"sub-content\">\n                When it is a players turn, a prompt will appear in their turn\n                box. Each turn consists of a movement, suggestion, and\n                accusation.\n              </p>\n              <p id=\"sub-header\">Movement:</p>\n              <p id=\"sub-content\">\n                The rooms are laid out in a 3x3 grid with a hallway separating\n                each pair of adjacent rooms. Each hallway only holds one person.\n                If someone is currently in a hallway, you may not move there.\n                The player may select an adjacent room or hallway to move into\n                as long as the movement is valid. If not, then the player will\n                receive an alert that the movement is invalid. The player may\n                choose the “no movement” option if they do not wish to move\n                their character during a turn.\n              </p>\n              <p id=\"sub-header\">Suggestion:</p>\n              <p id=\"sub-content\">\n                The player may select a suspect and weapon card to suggest from\n                the presented dropdown menus. Once the player submits their\n                suggestion, each subsequent player will be asked if they have\n                any of the selected cards. If the next player has a card they\n                must disprove the suggestion by showing the suggester that card.\n                If they have multiple suggested cards, the player may select\n                which card they would like to show to the suggester. If they\n                don’t have any of the suggested cards, the next player will be\n                asked, until every other player has been asked to disprove.\n              </p>\n              <p id=\"sub-header\">Accusation:</p>\n              <p id=\"sub-content\">\n                At the end of their turn, each player has the option to make an\n                accusation in which they can guess the suspect, weapon, and room\n                card that was chosen and hidden at the beginning of the game. If\n                the player does not wish to make an accusation they can simply\n                select, “no accusation” Otherwise the player can select a card\n                from each type in the dropdown menus. If the accusation is\n                correct then they win the game. Otherwise that player loses and\n                is out of the game.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"helpModal\" class=\"modal\">\n          <div class=\"modalWrapper\">\n            <div class=\"modalContent\" id=\"content\">\n              <span onClick={closeHelp} class=\"close fixed\">\n                &times;\n              </span>\n              <h1>Help Menu</h1>\n              <p id=\"sub-header\">Frequently Asked Questions:</p>\n              <p id=\"sub-italic-left\">Where can I see the cards in my hand?</p>\n              <p id=\"sub-content\">\n                The current cards in your hand are located in the \"Player Hand\"\n                section of the right divider on the page.

I have BS\n                degrees in both Psychology and Computer Science from SUNY (State\n                University of New York) Brockport, and this is my first class\n                towards an MS in Computer Science. Since graduating from\n                undergrad in 2018 I've known that I've wanted to go back to\n                school to get my masters just because I love learning new things\n                and expanding my horizons, and I'm really excited to finally be\n                on this path. All of my undergraduate work was in Java, however\n                most of my career work has been in C++ so I feel proficient in\n                both. I'm also familiar with Python. In general I'm organized\n                and detail oriented, which admittedly can sometimes lead to a\n                little bit of perfectionism. I'm good at sticking to schedules,\n                and I prefer to get things done early enough that there is some\n                wiggle room in case there are any last minute roadblocks. (I'm\n                also a big NFL fan and try to get things done early enough to\n                avoid doing work during the games on Sundays!). I like to have\n                work delegated and have clear, defined tasks for everyone on the\n                team. I've worked on small teams since I began my professional\n                career, and enjoy working with others, being a team player and\n                working together to make sure the team succeeds. In my spare\n                time I love to read, take pictures, and explore the outdoors.\n                While my true happy place is the beach, I recently started\n                exploring the Adirondack region which is practically in my\n                backyard now and have been loving every second of it.

Since graduating college in 2018, I have been working\n                at Leidos as a software engineer. I currently work on software\n                that air traffic controllers across the nation rely on 24/7 to\n                direct aircrafts.

Since I\n                don’t imagine anyone’s first choice of programming languages\n                will be Ada, I’m also familiar with Java, C, and C++. As a team\n                member, I'm super reliable, a quick learner and always willing\n                to lend a hand if needed. What I'm looking for in other team\n                members is open, consistent communication. After doing my own\n                research, I love brainstorming and bouncing ideas around with my\n                team members. In my opinion, collaboration is the key to\n                developing the best software or product. As for my schedule, I\n                live in Maryland, typically work 9AM to 5PM and will be\n                available in the evening and on weekends. I’m excited to be\n                taking this course and starting my grad school journey! I’m\n                really hoping to learn a lot through this course and be able to\n                apply these software engineering techniques back into work. A\n                fun fact about me is I brew my own kombucha (fermented tea with\n                probiotic benefits) at home. I also love gardening and\n                pickling/canning my own vegetables. I even built my own raised\n                herb/flower bed earlier this summer.\n              </p>\n              <h3>Erik Riis</h3>\n              <p id=\"sub-content\">\n                My name is Erik Riis and I work as a software engineer for GE\n                Healthcare as part of a rotational engineering development\n                program. I have always wanted to attend graduate school to\n                continue my education and being a part of the program has\n                afforded me the chance to do so while working part time. This is\n                going to be my first course at JHU but I am excited to dive in!\n                I prefer working in Java and Python but have experience with and\n                am comfortable working in other languages. As an undergraduate I\n                went to Duke University and studied computer science and\n                electrical and computer engineering. For a little about myself,\n                I live in San Diego, CA and love going to the beach and surfing.\n                I also like to be creative and paint and draw in my free time.\n              </p>\n              <h3>Sidney Jackson</h3>\n              <p id=\"sub-content\">\n                My name is Sidney Jackson. This past summer I enrolled in my\n                first EP CS course and am looking forward to another semester of\n                classes. For background, I received a B.S. in Computer\n                Engineering in 2018 and have been working as a Software Engineer\n                at a government contractor since. In the past, I’ve worked as an\n                embedded systems engineer and developed Android mobile\n                applications, but I’m currently doing backend software\n                development in Java for the project I’m currently working on.\n                Though I’ve taken CS courses as an undergraduate, I’ve never\n                actually formally taken a class about Software Engineering, so\n                I’m excited to take a course that will reintroduce me to the\n                field and reinforce concepts/principles that I might’ve picked\n                up on but haven’t thoroughly studied. Outside of work and\n                school, I enjoy playing guitar, woodworking, and being outdoors.\n              </p>\n              <h3>Sophia Anousheh</h3>\n              <p id=\"sub-content\">\n                Hello everyone! My name is Sophia Anousheh and I work as a\n                contractor /Scrum Master. I have been working in software\n                industry for about 8 years. Although I have experience\n                programming with C# and Java Script libraries like React for\n                small, and large-scale projects, I do not consider myself a\n                programmer. Being a Scrum master, I am a good team player,\n                listen actively, and demonstrate reliability. I am responsible\n                for keeping the entire team on schedule and ensuring that no\n                task assignments escape notice. A large part of my job is to\n                help everyone on the team follow guidelines through the\n                development process. I am excited to be in this class and have\n                the opportunity to learn more about the applications of\n                object-oriented programing and Agile project management\n                approaches. I currently live in Fairfax, Virginia with my\n                husband. Something unique about myself, I absolutely love\n                cooking and find it very therapeutic. Other than cooking, I love\n                watching Space and Aviation YouTube channels like “Scott\n                Manley”, and “Mentour Pilot”.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"settingsModal\" class=\"modal\">\n          <div class=\"modalWrapper\">\n            <div class=\"modalContent\">\n              <span onClick={closeSettings} class=\"close fixed\">\n                &times;\n              </span>\n              <h1>Game Settings</h1>\n              <p class=\"settings\"> Select Color Scheme: </p>\n              <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"column\" onClick={colorSchemeBlue}>\n                  <img src=\"./SettingColors/BlueColor.png\" width=\"25\" />\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"column\" onClick={colorSchemeRed}>\n                  <img src=\"./SettingColors/RedColor.png\" width=\"25\" />\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"column\" onClick={colorSchemeGreen}>\n                  <img src=\"./SettingColors/GreenColor.png\" width=\"25\" />\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"column\" onClick={colorSchemeYellow}>\n                  <img src=\"./SettingColors/YellowColor.png\" width=\"25\" />\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"column\" onClick={colorSchemePink}>\n                  <img src=\"./SettingColors/PinkColor.png\" width=\"25\" />\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"column\" onClick={colorSchemeSilver}>\n                  <img src=\"./SettingColors/SilverColor.png\" width=\"25\" />\n                </div>\n                <div> </div>\n              </div>\n              <p class=\"settings\"> Music Options: </p>\n              <Music></Music>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Masthead;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
